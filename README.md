# GA Project 2: Civic data analyses

--- 

## Directions

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". 

Skillsets I gained from this assignment:

    - Analysis of diverse datasets.
    - Form hypotheses and justify them with statistical testing in NumPy. 
    - Visualizing and interpreting data, with plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
